Automatic FEN to chess diagram generator works with the below Markdown syntax:

```
<FEN>[fen]</FEN>
```

Replace "[fen]" with a valid FEN and the result will be a diagram:

<FEN>r2qk2r/pb1p1pp1/2p4p/4p3/3bP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 14</FEN>

All diagrams are automatically sized to 400px in all pages.

Also, if you want a post to feature a diagram as a thumbnail, type the FEN in the post front matter as shown below:

```

...
FEN: ...
